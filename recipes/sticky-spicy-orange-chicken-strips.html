    <h3>Steps to Cooking</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                As I always preach, marination is a darling of a process. It is a process through with not only do we
                get to tenderize our meat, but we also get to infuse flavor into the flesh itself. This recipe was no
                different.
            </p>
            <p>
                Slice your chicken and place it in a container. I sliced my chicken into strips but I later on wished I sliced into cubes instead. Either is ok, but those were just my internal musings at the time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add your marination ingredients, mix, cover and let this sit for 1- 48 hours. Mine marinated overnight. Remember the longer you marinate, the more intense the flavors get.
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The following day, about an hour before cooking, let the marinated chicken sit on your counter and allow it to come to room temp. Reason being, when you cook cold meats, they tend to toughen and dry up. Once at room temp, add ¼ cup of corn starch and mix. You can get corn starch on any well stocked supermarket, a pack goes for 120 bob.
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The corn starch gives the chicken some crunch and crispiness. Proceed to sear until golden crispy.
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Set aside
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                To the same pan you removed your chicken from, add in the garlic, ginger, dania stems and the orange zest. Orange zest means the grated rind of an orange.  That means if you have 10 bob in your pocket, you already have your orange zest.
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Cook until softened and fragrant.
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Next in, add in the ketchup, a splash of orange juice, chili, brown sugar, soy sauce and the cornstarch + water mixture. See we have corn starch twice in the recipe: At the beginning before searing and a bit more during cooking. We have already spoken about it’s purpose during searing. Its purpose during this stage is to thicken the sauce and add a sheen to it. You can watch the compilation process of the sauce from  6.37- 6.52.
                Simmer on low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time. It should look gloriously thick and rich. (see 6.56)
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Once thick, add in the crispy chicken+ some fresh dania. Mix, and once coated, serve. Do not let it stay too long on the heat, we just need it coated.
                I served my sticky spicy orange chicken with some plantain and broccoli. And boy oh boy, this was one unforgettable plate!
            </p>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The flavors of the chicken were mind-blowing! The sweetness of the brown sugar contrasted with the heat of the chili. The warm zesty notes of the orange were prominent and went so so well with the herby notes or the rosemary that we had in the marinate. The chicken was tender and juicy and the flavors we put together for this recipe simply made it shine!!
